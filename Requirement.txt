 1. Software Requirements

•	Python 3.9+ (main programming language)

 Libraries:

•	langchain → to connect GPT-like models and tools

•	openai → if you are using OpenAI’s GPT models

•	yfinance or alpha_vantage → to fetch stock data

•	pandas, numpy → for data handling and analysis

•	matplotlib, seaborn, plotly → for visualization

•	scikit-learn → for stock prediction models (Linear Regression, etc.)

•	streamlit or flask → if you want a simple app interface

2. Hardware Requirements

•	A normal PC or laptop (8GB RAM recommended, since large models take memory).

•	Internet connection (needed for API calls).

•	If you want to train large models, GPU (NVIDIA) helps, but for your minor project, CPU is enough.


3. Other Requirements

•	API keys (from Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or OpenAI if using GPT).

•	GitHub for version control and project backup.

•	VS Code / PyCharm as your IDE.
